Urgent:
    The update method also need to make sure the editing range is not None ----> DONE

Test Track:
    File Watcher    ---------> DONE
    Metadata Worker ------------> DONE
    DA worker -------------> DONE
    Enough Video -------------> DONE
    Initialized Editing -----------> DONE
    Update Editing
    FF_memory database -----------> DONE
    Metadata database ------------> DONE

Notice:
    Need to make sure that the initializer's enough quantity is the same with the editing worker's num_video field
    Need to change the size of the range in range finder so the video results are not fragmented
    When passing the data to the editing server, always pass the JSON file first
    Currently only the end json file is used
    Need to know the RAM of the Robot before hand to normalize the data

Change:
    Added the filter functions in the range_finder.py, so that there is no fragmented one frame length ranges
